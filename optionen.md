- [How to Build a $20k - $100k Option Portfolio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KN6pazdUlg)
   - With a daily theta decay of 0.1 % of your portfolio, you can earn 360 days * 0.1 % per day = 36 % of your portfolio.
     If you can keep around 25 % of your theta, this means 9 % returns per year.
      - With 0.2 % theta decay of your portfolio, this might result in 18 % returns in a full year.
   - Bearish Delta: Aim for Delta/Theta = 1/2: With 100 theta you should have a delta of -50.
   - Bullish Deltas: SPY at $450 -> 100 SPY = $45.000:
      - Delta 100 means leverage of 1:1 with $45.000 portfolio.
      - Delta 200 means leverage of 2:1 with $45.000 portfolio.
   - Neutral Deltas: max +- 0.1 % of portfolio: With $100.000 portfolio this is max +- 100 delta.

Wenn man anstelle von Spreads direkt Naked Puts als Stillhalter schreibt, dann kann man auch mit 75 % einbehaltener
Prämie rechnen. Damit bekommt man 360 days * 0.04 % per day * 75 % = 10.8 % Jahresgewinn mit Stillhaltergeschäften.
Bei einem SPY von 450 und damit einem eingesetzten Kapital von 45.000 USD braucht man für ein Theta von 0.04 %
einen Tages-Decay von 45.000 USD * 0.04 % = 18 USD im Account.


Black Swan Hedge (BSH) und der Airbag Trade von Optionsuniversum
----------------------------------------------------------------

Der Black Swan Hedge ist eine Absicherung gegen sehr starke Rücksetzer. Möglichst auch mit ansteigender
Volatilität. Ein Aufsetzen kann weitgehend kosten-neutral erfolgen.

- Sehr ausführliche Erklärungen zu möglichen Hedges und dem Aufsetzen des Airbag Trades von Optionsuniversum:
   - <https://www.optionsuniversum.de/produkt/airbag-trade-hedge-trades-schutz-vor-marktcrashes/>
- Der BSH wird sehr ausführlich im Buch
  ["Optionen handeln mit Köpfchen" von Benjamin Friedenheim](https://www.hugendubel.de/de/buch_gebunden/benjamin_friedenheim-optionen_handeln_mit_koepfchen_profitable_tips_aus_der_praxis_fuer_fortgeschrittene_optionstrader-42038956-produkt-details.html) erläutert (Kapitel 10 Hedging).
- [Drawbridge Finance: Black Swan Hedge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ghl_GfNs99c)
   - Hedge trade in SPX or /ES.
   - Step 1: If the market is trading down at least -0.5%: Sell 3 puts (per Tranche) 90-120 DTE for credit: $3.00 each.
   - Step 2: Immediately place 2 GTC (Good Till Cancel) orders:
      - First GTC to buy 5 puts at the strike 50 points below the short puts, same expiration, using the debit shown in column N.
         - You received 3x$3.00=$9.00 credit from first trade. Now you can spend a bit less than $9.00/5=$1.80 for the long puts.
           You need to subtract commissions, fees and maybe closing price, so one long put can cost around $1.60.
      - Second GTC order to buy to close the initial short puts for a debit of $-0.20.
   - Step 3: If at 21 DTE the short puts are still open, buy to close to remove Gamma risk.
     This may cost more than the intended $-0.20 debit which could result in a small cost of this hedge to be in play.
     The small cost will be well worth the potential return in a massive selloff.
   - If you have completed steps 1 to 3 above, this is called one tranche of a BSH. Once a tranche is complete, you
     should immediately start setting up your next tranche to increase your hedge.
   - Setting up the first tranche of the BSH, you are exposed to a very high risk in case of a market selloff.
     Once the hedge is in place, setting up further tranches of the BSH involves less risk.
     If several tranches are setup, you only reduce your downside hedge while setting up new tranches.
   - Example in /ES which has a multiplier of 50: Selling 3 puts at about $3.00, you will receive a
     credit of 3x50x$3.00=$450. The GTC order buys 5 long puts for 5x50x$1.80=$450 or a bit less.
   - Example with SPX options with a multiplier of 100: Selling 3 puts at about $3.00, you will receive a
     credit of 3x100x$3.00=$900. The GTC order buys 5 long puts for 5x100x$1.80=$900.
   - To adjust to current SP500 market prices, you should double all the prices: Sell 3 puts at about $6.00
     to receive a credit of 3x$6.00=$18.00 and buy 5 puts for less than $18.00/5=$3.60.
     This is now $900 in /ES and $1800 with SPX options.
   - For an effective hedge you should have puts about 20% below current market level or more than delta 2
     with options.
- Sweet Bobby hat den BSH hier erklärt: [How to trade the Black Swan Hedge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Tm_GBJauk)
   - Strikes - sell three short puts at approximately $3. Buy 5 long puts 50 points below the shorts. (/ES)
   - Days To Expiration (DTE) - begin the entire campaign by purchasing 4 BSH tranches outright at
     approximately 120 DTE, ideally on a day when the market is up.
     Subsequent tranches must be equal or greater than 60 DTE.
   - Factory Campaign - once the initial campaign has begun, sell additional short puts on a day when
     the market is down 0.4 % or more or after two consecutive down days (especially after two days of
     increasing volatility).
     Use the BSH calculator to buy the puts when the entire trade can be put on at a breakeven or a slight credit.
   - It is permissible to sell new puts as soon as the long puts are filled.
   - If 24 days have passed and no additional BSH tranches have begun, it may be necessary to purchase
     outright BSH tranches to keep the campaign going. It is permissible to diagonalize the outright
     BSH tranches so that the shorts are in a longer expiration than the longs so that the entire trade
     can be placed for breakeven or a small credit.
   - Short Put Harvest - harvest the short puts at 20 cents or when they reach 14 DTE, whichever comes first.
   - Alternative Harvest - harvest the short puts along with an equal number of long puts at 20 cents or less.
   - Increase tranch sizing when possible. The goal is to develop a wall of thousands of BSH tranches.

   - Buy the spreadsheet for $119: <https://5519505428805.gumroad.com/l/sweetbobbyspreadsheet>
- Sweet Bobby Trading Plan 2024-04-24.
- The trading strategy is composed of two primary components: naked puts and a put debit spread.
- The strategy involves either a 1-1-1 or a 1-1-2 trade.
- A 1-1-1 trade is comprised of an out-of-the-money put debit spread and one out-of-the-money naked put.
- A 1-1-2 trade is comprised of an out-of-the-money put debit spread and two out-of-the-money naked puts.
- Ideally, a 1 to 1 ratio of naked positions to put debit spreads is preferred.
- Naked Puts - either one or two puts are sold:
   - Days to Expiration (DTE): Closest to 120 days to expiration.
   - Strike: Sell one 10-delta put for a 1-1-1. Sell two 5-delta puts for a 1-1-2.
   - Management: Naked puts are usually closed at 95% profit or when they reach 30 to 21 days to expiration,
     but subject to overall portfolio metrics. It is acceptable to allow the naked puts to expire out of the money.
   - 2x loss: It is permissible to close the naked puts at a loss equal to two times the initial credit received.
   - 30 delta breach: If the short strike becomes a 30 delta or higher, permission is granted to either close the trade
     and accept the loss or to place the put in "Problem Child" status where the debits and credits of the trade are
     monitored to ensure that the trade is ultimately profitable.
      - The puts are closed for a loss.
      - The position can be rolled down farther away from the underlying price in the same expiration and
        repositioned by selling twice the number of naked puts so that the credit received is equal to or
        greater than the debit required to close the initial puts.
        Thus, the position becomes either a 1-1-2 or a 1-1-4.
      - Alternatively, the position can be rolled out farther in time and possibly farther away from the current price
        of the underlying and repositioned so that the credit received is equal to or greater than the debit required
        to close the initial puts.
- Put Debit Spread - a put debit spread is bought:
   - Day to Expiration (DTE): Use the same expiration as the naked puts.
   - Width: 50-points wide (or 300 points).
   - Cost: Quoted at approximately a $10 debit (actual cost is $50 for /MES and $500 for /ES).
     Look for the long put to be approximately a 25 delta (for 50-wide PDS and 9 delta for 300-wide PDS).
   - Management: Under normal circumstances, the put debit spread expires worthless.
     Permission is granted to close the debit spread before expiration if:
      - The spread is approching full profit.
      - The current price of the underlying is under the "profit tent" of the put debit spread and is
        at risk of exiting the "profit tent" if not closed at a profit.
      - Any leg of the spread that is in the money must be closed before expiration
        to avoid exercise and assignment fees.


2-2-1 or 4-4-1 variation from Sweet Bobby
-----------------------------------------

- Days to Expiration (DTE): closest to 120 days to expiration
- Put Debit Spread (PDS): Buy either 2 PDS or 4 PDS.
- Width: 50-points wide put debit spread with the short leg placed near the expected move.
- Cost: Calculate the total debit for the put debit spreads. Then, sell a naked put so that the
  entire trade is put on at a near breakeven for for a small credit.
- Management: Under normal circumstances, the put debit spread expires worthless.
  Permission is granted to close the debit spread before expiration if:
   - The spread is approching full profit.
   - The current price of the underlying is under the "profit tent" of the put debit spread and is
     at risk of exiting the "profit tent" if not closed at a profit.
   - Any leg of the spread that is in the money must be closed before expiration
     to avoid exercise and assignment fees.


Strangles von Sweet Bobby
-------------------------

- DTE 90 days
- Short Put Strike at Delta 7
- Short Call Strike at Delta 6
- Strike deltas may be adjusted based on portfolio Greeks. Ratio strangles may also be used.
- Closed at 50% profit
- Close at loss of two times initial credit received.
- Delta 30 breach, execute one of:
   - Close for a loss.
   - Roll down at same expiration for puts, roll up for calls. Take same credit as debit paid to close the initial position.
   - Roll out in time and further away from current price. Credit recieved is same as debit paid to close initial position.


VIX Hedge von Sweet Bobby
-------------------------

- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfa8ww-JmjI>
- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-3TAUPzbzc>
- Buy 10-delta VIX calls equal to 0.25 % of the net liquidation value monthly at 120 days to expiration
  and repeast every 30 days so that over time, VIX calls are laddered into the 120, 90, 60, and 30-day expiration cycles.
- Or, instead of buying multiple 10-delta calls, buy a single VIX call using the alotted capital of
  0.25 % at a higher delta (closer to the at-the-money price of VIX).
- Although the VIX hedge can be implemented in all VIX environments, optimally, it could be used
  when VIX is under 20.
- The VIX headge's annual cost will equal 3 % of the account's net liquidation value.

Tom King portfolio management greeks for 2024:

The goal of the portfolio is to be as close to Delta neutral as possible depending
on the current market environment and to have as much Theta as we can to drive
the income generation of the account WITHOUT exceeding our BP (buying-power) limitations.

We monitor these 2 greeks as follows:

- Delta: beta-weighted to SPY: never more than 0.2% of NLV
- Theta: 0.4% of NLV is the targeted minimum

Risk management:

- Buying power is a measure of portfolio risk and the goal is to be at or below
  50% of available Buying Power in normal environments.
   - 50% is the goal since trading mostly futures and accounting for Span Margin increases.
   - In higher volatility times, you can exceed the 50% BP rule.
   - Never have more than 80% of my total portfolio invested at any given time overnight.
- Never risk more than 2% of my total portfolio on any one trade and size accordingly.
- Never invest more than 60% of my max allowed BP on any one strategy.
   - If I want to buy a new position, then weed out one of my existing positions.
     (Sell the loser or the non-performer first.)
- Never go into a trade looking at profits first. Look at max loss and size accordingly.

Tom King 112C (Calendarized 1-1-2 Trade)
----------------------------------------

- [Youtube Tom King: Calendarized 1-1-2 Trade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG0fmJ98-kA)
- This trade has a much shorter DTE for the short puts, thus they have a tad more risk,
  but come off quicker and we are left with a Put Debit Spread (PDS) for nearly 2-3 months.
  The ladder of PDS with help with BP (Buying Power) relief and Delta hedging.
- Buying Power and Sizing:
   - Trades using /ES
   - Size for max loss per trade of 2 % of Net Liq portfolio value.
     Increase size as needed within the BP limit.
- Trade Entry:
   - Enter a 100 wide PDS at 150 DTE (120 DTE is also an option) @ 15-20 delta long put
     for around $8-10 debit (Can change based on market profile).
   - Finance with 2 naked puts at 60 DTE around 6-7 delta to generate the desired credit.
     (I am aiming for $15-16 credit on the naked puts (NPs).
- Management:
   - Note: I manage the Naked Puts (NP) and the Put Debit Spread (PDS) as 2 separate trades.
   - Naked Put (NP) Management:
      - When NK are at 90 % of initial credit on the trade, close them. This frees up BP and
        makes the trade a free PDS hedge for 90+ days.
      - Close them at 2X (200 %) loss.
      - Roll them out (and down) if touched or near expiration.
        Note: You can close/adjust the PDS to pay for the roll.
      - Take assignment if BP allows. (Then wheel out with ATM Covered Calls.)
   - Put Debit Spread (PDS) Management:
      - Note: If any leg of the spread that is in the money (ITM) at expiration must be closed
        to avoid being exercised or assigned and fees.
      - Reduce risk: If the short put of the PDS hits 90-95 %+ profitability, you can close this contract
        and leave the long put open as a full hedge.
        Note: This will reduce income generation slightly.
      - Increase gains:
         - Wait until close to expiration to close at or near full spread profit.
         - If PDS is profitable early, we can look to capture part of the trap max profit by rolling the short
           put up by 50 % or more of the width of the PDS to lock in profit and still have a trap remaining.
           Note: Rolling up the short put of the PDS will keep the trap size larger and at a higher strike,
           thus creating a greater chance for the remaining adjusted PDS to pay off.
. Options for this 112C trade:
   - Income generators: Roll up the naked puts, roll up the short puts of the PDS, close some of the long puts,
     roll the whole PDS down.
   - Hedge generators: Remove the naked puts early, remove some of the naked puts, remove the shorts of the PDS,
     remove just a few of the puts of the PDS, close some naked puts and use the cash to roll up the long puts
     (make a wider trap).


Murray Lindhout: 1-1-1
----------------------

- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByN7YEGuZY>
- use uncorrelated underlyings
- stay with small size and buying power
- start with a normal 1-1-1
- Start with a wide PDS and then move the (lower) short put up over time, so that
  you collect additional income.
- If the market moves down and challenges the income short put, then buy back this short
  put and sell two further away short puts for a small credit. This is then a 1-1-2 trade.


Zoheb Noormohamed: 1-1-1
------------------------

- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3MDIGl7TjA>
   - 45-60 DTE with monthly expirations (for better liquidity).
   - Put Debit Spread as hedge. (Long option at Delta 30 and 5-10 width for the spread.)
   - Short Put at least 20% away from current market price. (Around Delta 20.)
   - $2 credit for the overall trade.
   - Individual stocks with RSI oversold or overbought.
- Close at 50 % max profit or roll at 21DTE (to next cycle).
- Managing the trade:
   - Close complete position and open a completely new position (rolloing down and out, possibly for a credit).
      - Maybe change to no credit above the debit spread of the trade to allow maximum roll down of the trade.
   - Close debit spread (with a profit) and use that to roll out the short put (down and out).
     Now you have one short naked put open.
   - Close the long leg of the debit spread and roll the two short puts down and out.
     You will now have two naked short puts and higher risk and margin requirement.

Portfolio Metrics von Sweet Bobby
---------------------------------

- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jx4QezyHz8>
- NLV = Net Liquidation Value = NetLiq

| metric                  | value                       |
|:------------------------|:----------------------------|
| SPY beta-weighted delta | < 0,15 % of NLV             |
| Min Theta               | \> 0,10 % of NLV            |
| Max Theta               | < 0,10 % of NLV if VIX < 15 |
|                         | < 0,20 % of NLV if VIX < 20 |
|                         | < 0,30 % of NLV if VIX < 30 |
|                         | < 0,40 % of NLV if VIX < 40 |
|                         | < 0,50 % of NLV if VIX > 40 |
| Max Buying Power        | < 25 % if VIX < 15          |
|                         | < 30 % if VIX < 20          |
|                         | < 35 % if VIX < 30          |
|                         | < 40 % if VIX < 40          |
|                         | < 50 % if VIX > 40          |

This means for 100K USD you should have < 150 delta and > 100 theta.
In a very volatile market with VIX more than 40, you should have a
maximum of 500 theta and a max buying power of 50 %.

      - trade is a bit more aggressive than 1-1-1, trade is similar to a butterfly
      - DTE 45-60, buy put at delta 25 and sell two further down puts with overall credit of the trade of $16-$20

      - If the market sells off, the naked put can be rolled down and out and the debit spread can be closed for a profit.

- Zero Extrinsic Hedged Back Spread (ZEEHBS)
   - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHggVlYlYZA&t=12s>
   - (Sell one ATM call and buy for the same price two lower long calls. Also go short 50 stocks.)
   - Sell two ATM calls and buy for the same price four lower long calls. Add one synthetic short
     by buying ATM put and selling ATM call.
   - Has nearly no extrinsic value.
   - If market goes up, take off the two long call spreads. This reduces valley of death.
   - If market goes down, move the short calls down. This adds more credit and reduces valley of death.
     And it reduces upside potential. Or just sell another short call.


Youtube "Steady Income Trading"
-------------------------------

- [Unified Options Trading Strategy from Steady Income Trading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG7qW77gtH8)
   - Trading /ES or SPX options. Trade this weekly for time diversification.
   - Naked Put (NP) for generating income:
      - 7-9 Delta, 80-100 DTE
      - Take Profit (TP) (or called Profit Target (PT)) at 60 %
      - Stop Loss or Stop Target (ST) at 250 % (or 200 %)
      - Win Rate should be around 90 % (or 85 %)
   - Put Debit Spread (PDS) as hedge / protection:
      - 35 Delta, Width 75 (Traditional is 25 Delta, Width 50)
         - The higher delta should change the hedge from costing money to be more cost neutral per average.
      - Take Profit (TP) at 80 % of max value
   - Look at Naked Put (NP) and Put Debit Spread (PDS) separately. They have their own PT/ST.
   - Trade about 2 PDS to 1 NP. Maybe a bit more PDS as NP are closed earlier.
     So we end up with a ratio of 1/3 to 1/5 with active trades.
   - NP are closed on market uptrend, PDS on market downtrend.
   - For overall account planning: If you plan with a Premium Capture Rate (PCR) of 28 % and you have
     a yearly return target of 25 %, you can calculate the premium sold over the year and thus per week.

Naming of Butterflies
---------------------

- all call butterfly (debit trade) is done on bullish outlook
- all put butterfly (debit trade) is done on bearish outlook
   - best traded with low IV and only small expected move
- call/put butterfly is called an iron butterfly (credit trade)
   - best traded with high IV


Broken Wing Butterfly (BWB)

Naming of option spreads
------------------------

- vertical, horizontal (calendar) and diagonal spreads:
   - Spreads with the same expiration date and different strike prices are called vertical spreads.
   - Spreads with the same strik price, but different expiration dates are called horizontal spreads.
      - Horizontal spreads are also called calendar spreads.
   - Spreads with differnet strike prices and different expiration dates are called diagonal spreads.
- credit and debit spreads:
   - Spreads that pay you money on entry are called credit spreads.
   - Spreads that cost you money on entry are called debit spreads.
- A double calendar is a combination of a bearish put calendar (e.g. delta 20) and a bullish call
  calendar (e.g. delta 15). Take profit with 8 to 10 % profit on the paid premium.


Calendar Spreads
----------------

- [NavigationTrading: Trading Calendar Spreads for Income](https://vimeo.com/720468103/b86fbaeba3)
- [OptionsWelten: Calendar Spreads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqJjD6bigac)
- Strike price is the same, but expiration date is different. This is called a horizontal spread.
- A longer running option is bought (usually with more premium) and a shorter running option is sold
  at the same strike price as the first option. The shorter running option should decayits premium
  faster than the longer running option.
- Best setup with the most premium is ATM. Other possibility is a bearish setup with delta 5 to 30.
- This can be setup with puts or with calls.
- Expectation is that the market stays sideways.
- Best setup if the front-month has more premium compared to the back-month. This is called
  backwardation and often goes back to contango pretty fast.
- Another good setup in low volatility as it can benefit from vola increase.
- Debit paid is the max risk.
- [Calendar Options from Brent Osachoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlywocCHoG0)
   - Put Calendars benefit from a volatility increase. Delta neutral. Theta positive. Vega positive (long vega).


Diagonal spread from Dan Sheridan
---------------------------------

- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V1rSEghTfY>
- entry for SPX (with low vola) an Friday at 3pm:
   - -1 Call Delta-20 with 5 DTE
   - +1 Call +10 points (from short call above) with 7 DTE
   - -1 Put Delta-25 with 5 DTE
   - +1 Put -10 points (from short put above) with 7 DTE
- call side with less delta to give more room to the upside
- exit
   - Profit Target 100%
   - if S/L (short/long) ratio below 0.05 (no premium left)
   - short put: exit this leg above delta 65
   - short call: exit this leg below delta -65
- 4.6 average days in trade and 68.4% win percentage

- <https://www.thetaprofits.com/flyagonal-how-a-hybrid-options-strategy-hit-a-96-win-rate/>
- Call-BWB and Diagonal Spread combined. Defined risk trade. (In SPX about $5000 risk.)
- SPX, but also RUT or even individual stocks.
- 8-10 DTE and double the days for the long call as part of the diagonal spread.
- Example:
   - SPX at 6368 on 2025-07-29.
   - Call-BWB with +1 call 6370, -2 call 6420, +1 call 6480 (10 DTE on 2025-08-08).
      - Call-BWB with 50 and 60 points wings, the upper side has a higher loss potential, less risk on the lower side.
      - Lower long call is ATM of the underlying (SPX).
      - Good theta and negative vega.
   - 10d/20d Diagonal Put Spread with -1 put 6320 2025-08-08 and +1 put 6300 2025-08-18.
      - Short put is 50 points below ATM.
      - positive vega and positive theta.
      - If theta increases (and usually the market drops), then the profit zone increases.
- Usual days In Trade (DIT) of about 4-5 days.
- Best if market does not move too much.
- Exit with 10 % of profit (based on the max loss).
   - If adjustments are made, then lower your profit expectancy.
- Always exit 3-4 days before the expiration.
- Adjustments in case of big moves up or down are part of a seminar.
- Adjustments often move the short strikes. Try to get about delta neutral.
   - Adjustments: Rare; usually a simple roll of a short leg.

   - [Put Broken Wing Butterflies (BWB)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f6En2g8Hbc)
      - +1 Delta -20, -2 Delta -40, +1 Delta -60 with 60+ DTE. Exit at 14 DTE.
   - [Calendar Spreads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpVDk4HTBYk)
   - [Option Spread Adjustments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9KqLjeQJuk)
- Entry: Put BWB in RUT: +1 Delta 20, -2 Delta 35, +1 Delta 50.
   - Some use slightly negative Delta, but I start with 0 Delta.
- Profit Target 10 % and stop loss 10 %.
- If RUT is at the two sold Puts, roll the whole structure back.
- If RUT is the upper long Delta and we have maybe -5 Delta or -10 Delta (of the overall trade),
  then do a delta adjustment: Either add a PCS or add a call calendar (monthly, at 40 delta).
- Huge move up: Move the whole structure up.
- With 56 DTE, add another Put BWB. Maybe flatten out overall delta.
